# Halite - Hack Days

Code written as part of a work-hosted [Halite-III](https://2018.halite.io) competition.

This project uses the Java starter kit from the official [Halite-III repo](https://github.com/HaliteChallenge/Halite-III).

### Setup
Use the halite executable found on the official [Halite-III repo](https://github.com/HaliteChallenge/Halite-III):

1. Clone the [Halite-III repo](https://github.com/HaliteChallenge/Halite-III)
2. Follow instructions to compile the executable on the [game engine README](https://github.com/HaliteChallenge/Halite-III/blob/master/game_engine/README.md)
3. Move the executable to this repo.

### Run a game
Use the `run_game` scripts to compile and run a game:
```
sh run_game.sh StarterBot HeapBot
```

When you run a game, some output is generated in log files and an `.hlt` file. 
The `.hlt` file can be dropped in [Halite visualizer](https://2018.halite.io/watch-games) to watch the game.
